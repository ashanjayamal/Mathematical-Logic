Without changing their meanings, convert each of the following sentences into a
sentence having the form "P if and only if Q."

1. A series converges whenever it converges absolutely.  
2. For a function to be continuous, it is sufficient that it is differentiable.
3. For a function to be continuous, it is necessary that it is integrable.  
4. A function is rational if it is a polynomial.  
5. An integer is divisible by 8 only if it is divisible by 4.
6. For matrix \( A \) to be invertible, it is necessary and sufficient that \( \det(A) \neq 0 \).
