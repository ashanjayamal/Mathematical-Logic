# Set Theory


## Introduction to Sets

```{definition}
A **set** is an unordered collection of “objects.” The objects in a set are called the **elements** or **members** of the set. A set contains its elements.

- A set is usually denoted by a capital letter, say \( A \).
- An element is usually denoted by a lowercase letter, say \( a \) or \( b \).
- We write \( a \in A \) to mean “\( a \) is an element of \( A \).”
- We write \( a \notin A \) to mean “\( a \) is not an element of \( A \),” i.e., \( \sim (a \in A) \).
```

```{example}

- Consider the objects \( 0, 2, -3, 5 \).  
  The collection \( \{0, 2, -3, 5\} \) is a set.  
  The elements of this set are \( 0, 2, -3, 5 \).

- Statement:  
  \( -3 \)is a member of the set \(\{0, 2, -3, 5\} \)

- Statement:  
  \( 4 \) is not a member of the set \( \{0, 2, -3, 5\} \)
```

**Note**

When we consider the collection of all integers, we obtain a set. Any integer is a member of this set. Any object that is not an integer is not a member of this set.

It is not possible to write down all the integers explicitly. However, we can indicate this set using ellipsis notation:

\[
\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}
\]

Here, the dots (\( \dots \)) represent the members that are not written down, and it is understood what they are.


**Set-Builder Notation**

- The set \( \left\{ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \dots \right\} \) can be written as:  \(  \left\{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}\)
  
This reads: “The set whose members are \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) ranges over all natural numbers.”

- The set \( \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x > -3\} \) is equal to \(  \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}\)

```{definition,name='Subset'}

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets.  
We say that \( A \) is a **subset** of \( B \), denoted \( A \subseteq B \), if and only if every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \).

Formally: \(A \subseteq B \iff \forall x \, (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B)\)
```

```{example}  
Let \( A = \{1, 2, 4\} \) and \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).  
Then \( A \subseteq B \), but \( B \nsubseteq A \).
```

**Note**: 
Let \( A \) be a set.  
Then \(A = \{x \mid p(x)\} \), where \( p(x) \) is a predicate.  
An element \( x \in A \) if and only if \( p(x) \) is true.




```{definition,name='Proper Subset'}

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets.  
We say that \( A \) is a **proper subset** of \( B \), denoted \( A \subset B \), if and only if:

1. \( A \subseteq B \), and  
2. There exists an element \( x_0 \in B \) such that \( x_0 \notin A \).

Formally:
\[
A \subset B \iff \left( \forall x \, (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B) \right) \land \left( \exists x_0 \in B \, (x_0 \notin A) \right)
\]
```


```{definition,name='Equality of Sets'}

Two sets \( A \) and \( B \) are **equal**, denoted \( A = B \), if and only if:

1. \( A \subseteq B \), and  
2. \( B \subseteq A \)

This is equivalent to:
\[
A = B \iff \forall x \, (x \in A \Leftrightarrow x \in B)
\]
or
\[
A = B \iff \left( \forall x \, (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B) \right) \land \left( \forall x \, (x \in B \Rightarrow x \in A) \right)
\]

```

```{definition ,name='Singleton Set'}

A set containing exactly one element is called a **singleton set**.
```

```{definition,name='Empty Set'}

The set with no elements is called the **empty set**, denoted by \( \emptyset \) or \( \{\} \).  
Note: \( \{\emptyset\} \) is not the empty set—it is the set containing the empty set as an element.
```


```{example}

- \( \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x^2 = 2\} = \emptyset \)
- \( \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } x^2 < 0\} = \emptyset \)

Observe:
\[
\{x \mid x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } x^2 = 2\} = \{x \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } x^2 < 0\}
\]

```

```{definition,name='Power Set'}

Let \( A \) be a set.  
The **power set** of \( A \), denoted \( \mathcal{P}(A) \), is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{P}(A) = \{X \mid X \subseteq A\}
\]
That is, the set of all subsets of \( A \).
```

```{example}  
Let \( A = \{0, 1\} \).  
Then:
\[
\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}
\]
```

```{definition ,name='Universal Set'}

A **universal set** is the largest set under consideration, relative to a given context. It contains all elements of the sets being discussed.

- Denoted by \( U \) or \( E \)
- Example: If we are considering subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \), then the universal set is \( \mathbb{R} \)
```

**Summary**:

1. **Subset Definition**  
   \[
   A \subseteq B \iff \forall x \, (x \in A \Rightarrow x \in B)
   \]

2. **Non-subset**  
   \[
   A \nsubseteq B \iff \sim (A \subseteq B)
   \]

3. **Equality of Sets**  
   \[
   A = B \iff A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A
   \]

4. **Singleton Set**  
   Example: \(   A = \{2\}\)

5. **Empty Set**  
   \[   \emptyset,\{\}   \]

6. **Power Set**  
   \[
   \mathcal{P}(A) = \{X \mid X \subseteq A\}
   \]

7. **Universal Set**  
   Denoted \( E \) or \( U \)

#### Set Opertaions


##### Union

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets.  
The **union** of \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \cup B \), is the set containing all elements that are in \( A \), in \( B \), or in both.

\[
A \cup B = \{ x \mid x \in A \lor x \in B \}
\]

**Note:**  
\[
x \in A \cup B \iff x \in A \lor x \in B
\]

---

##### Intersection

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets.  
The **intersection** of \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \cap B \), is the set containing all elements that are in both \( A \) and \( B \).

\[
A \cap B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \in B \}
\]

**Note:**  
\[
x \in A \cap B \iff x \in A \land x \in B
\]

---

##### Complement

Let \( A \subseteq E \), where \( E \) is a universal set.  
The **complement** of \( A \), denoted \( A^c \), is the set of all elements in \( E \) that are not in \( A \).

\[
A^c = \{ x \mid x \in E \land x \notin A \}
\]

**Note:**  
\[
x \in A^c \iff x \in E \land x \notin A
\]

---

##### **Difference**

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets.  
The **difference** of \( A \) and \( B \), denoted \( A \setminus B \), is the set of elements that are in \( A \) but not in \( B \).

\[
A \setminus B = \{ x \mid x \in A \land x \notin B \}
\]

**Note:**  
\[
x \in A \setminus B \iff x \in A \land x \notin B
\]

Also called: 

- The **complement of \( B \) in \( A \)**
- The **relative complement of \( B \) with respect to \( A \)**
